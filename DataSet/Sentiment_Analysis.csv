If you are going to use it, be sure to read the instructions and warnings. 

This product has a period of time at the beginning of use that makes your acne worse and then clears it. I went through this process when I started taking Spironolactone, so I knew what to expect and I trusted that it would go away - it did. 

My skin looks and feels fantastic! I still get an occasional zit here at there - I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s my fault as I&#039;m a toucher/picker/popper. 

This is an easy product to add to your routine. Make sure to use it at night and wash off in the morning so you don&#039;t have to worry about sunburns.

First, Retin A will make the skin soft and susceptible to damage so do not pick skin as it can rip off layers causing scars. I use a sensitive skin soap such as Cetaphil sensitive skin soap. DO NOT scrub your face which stimulates sebum production. Use your finger tips and be as gentle as possible washing face AM/PM daily.
When starting retinoids/ Epiduo, apply at night after washing and let face dry 20min. Apply 50/50 with Cetaphil eczema sensitive skin moisturizer. If you skin is red skip a night but I found that this moisturizer will eliminate the redness.

My only complaint and reason for considering switching is that after taking this long term, I recently developed spider veins on my thighs. I have NEVER had such a thing so it was very concerning as I am only 25 and in very good health, and as I know there are increased risks for DVT while taking this drug. Recently the areas on my thigh where the spider veins developed have become somewhat painful at work (as I stand all day). I attribute the development of the spider veins directly to Loryna as this is only medication I have taken the past couple years.

If you are going to use it, be sure to read the instructions and warnings. 

This product has a period of time at the beginning of use that makes your acne worse and then clears it. I went through this process when I started taking Spironolactone, so I knew what to expect and I trusted that it would go away - it did. 

My skin looks and feels fantastic! I still get an occasional zit here at there - I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s my fault as I&#039;m a toucher/picker/popper.

I&#039;m your typical 18 year old lad and have never written on a forum before but I want to write something for the people that are worried about taking this (in my opinion) miracle drug. I am coming to the end of my 6 month course and I can honestly say it&#039;s been life changing. 

Before I started Roaccutane, I was fairly depressed and seriously lacking confidence due to my appearance. But after months of failed treatments on various antibiotics, I was referred to a dermatologist who instantly said there&#039;s only one way to fix my acne problem, Roaccutane. At first I thought this is the worst case scenario and I&#039;m going to be even more depressed as a result of the possible mental health side affects. Depression has run in my family so I was very worried. However, living like with acne wasn&#039;t something I was prepared to do, so I started the course on 40mg a day.

The first week I had a headache daily, but thankfully these die off after a week and paracetamol and ibuprofen will take all the pain away. Almost immediately, my lips were cracking and from then on in, I never went anywhere without some Carmex lip balm in my pocket.

As the first 3 months went by, I was still breaking out and was starting to think it isn&#039;t going to work. However, I&#039;m so glad I stuck with it because now I haven&#039;t got a single spot of my face and the scars have faded to the point where you can barely see them! After the third month, my derm upped my dose and I started to take 60mg a day. 

Luckily for me I hadn&#039;t had any serious side affects. Just your occasional nose bleed and dry skin, and sometimes my eyes were a bit blurry but it&#039;s not much of an issue.

Anyway, I just want anyone reading this that is worried about starting this medication, that not everyone has a horror story about Roaccutane and I couldn&#039;t be happier at how it&#039;s made me feel!!

I&#039;ve been waiting for the day I get to write my own review.  
I officially started using Retin- A .25 just under 4 months ago today.  My first day was 3 weeks before my birthday.  I remember contacting my Dermo in advance with a million questions and mostly the fear of going through THE PURGE during this busy time filled with celebrations, events, etc.  I thankfully, made the gamble and started!  I decided it was always be... I&#039;ll start next week, next month.  Let&#039;s be real, when is there ever a good time for acne?!  
I can only describe the last 4 months as a roller coaster.  There will be good days. There will be days you hide inside. At some points I thought I was done purging, then it would come back.  IT TAKES TIME.  Painful cysts too, that do not go away.  I would rather have 20 white head pimples all over than 1 deep painful cyst on my face!  It was the most challenging thing I&#039;ve gone through. It will test your patience.  To the point of tears, and why me&#039;s!  At one point I scheduled an emergency Dermo appt to receive Cortizon injections on 3 cysts that were almost the size of dimes!! I couldn&#039;t take it anymore.  This was 2.5 months. He sat me down and said it takes 3-4 months for results to be reached and you will hate your dermo for that time and gave me the push to continue to go forward.
Here&#039;s the good news!  I am at my 4 month mark, and I have never been more happy.  I haven&#039;t had a break out in 1.5 weeks.  I don&#039;t know the last time I&#039;ve been able to say that. I can take on the CALI summer and not feel like I&#039;m hiding.  My biggest advise is be strong!   Tell yourself everyday, it&#039;s only 4 months of the rest of your life.

I was discouraged the first few months due to my face breaking out worse, having senstive, red, dry patchy skin but it is worth it. The clarity of my skin after using this is refreshing I&#039;m 20 and I&#039;ve been using it since I was 18. Currently I just use it for spot treatment whenever I have mini break outs!""",Positive,10,3

Going on Claravis wasn&#039;t easy, but I&#039;ve been off it for 2 months and haven&#039;t had one zit yet. It changed my life and boosted my self confidence extraordinarily. I get compliments on my skin all the time and I am so so so so SO thankful for Claravis - it was my miracle and I know without it my skin would have never ever been this beautiful.""",Positive,10,14

I have the worst acne I&#039;ve ever had, not just my face but my back and chest too. I get headaches all the time and I&#039;ve gained 20 pounds. It&#039;s like my appetite for food sky rocketed. My appetite for sexual activity, however, got depleted. Which is frustrating. """,Positive,3,11

I had minimal breakouts on just my forehead and it honestly wasn&#039;t the worst, but I wanted it to be gone. My derm prescribed me with this medication for two months and  after three weeks of taking the pill I started getting giant cysts on my jawline and cheeks. It is truly awful and I feel as if it is a waste of money and effort.""",Negative,1,1
acne,Drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol,"[' skin_rash', ' pus_filled_pimples', ' blackheads', ' scurring', 0, 0, 0]","""I&#039;ve been on yaz for about 3 months because of my severe acne. In the first two months my acne remained the same but my boobs increased in about a size and a half, which my doctor warned me about. It doesnt bother me as now my breast are fuller/ rounder however I have quite a few stretch marks. So I&#039;d recommend using bio oil on your chest and hips for the first few months on yaz just in case this happenes to you. At around month 3 my skin is not breaking out anywhere near as much. I&#039;m amazed by my skin, it&#039;s never been so good. Overall I have never been so happy with my skin and I haven&#039;t even finished my third month. I still feel it getting better every day. I have experienced no other side effects beside slight fatigue.""",Positive,9,11
acne,Adapalene / benzoyl peroxide,"[' skin_rash', ' pus_filled_pimples', ' blackheads', ' scurring', 0, 0, 0]","""I am 37 and never had acne until 7 months ago. Pimples on my jawline and forehead with acne scars started to wear  on my self esteem. I&#039;ve been using epiduo for 5 days and can already see an improvement. I purchased a mild facial wash, toner and moisturizer with spf 20 from Clinique to use while I&#039;m in treatment. No irritation or flaking or burning, just clearer skin and the scars are starting to fade already. I use my normal skin regimen in the am and the epiduo at night. I love this product.""",Positive,9,4

Surprisingly, being in the sun helped a lot and then my doctor recommended epiduo. I was excited to finally have clear skin. Then I tried it out for two weeks. I noticed my skin getting progressively worse. Then after a while, I began feeling an odd burning sensation. The next morning I woke up to blotchy, painful, burning skin. Basically nothing could soothe it and I started school later that week. The burning was terrible and makeup couldn&#039;t cover it. I&#039;ve tried various moisturizers but none helped. I was stuck with skin that was a lot worse than before I started, and a blotchy, burning, bright red spotty face. I don&#039;t recommend trying this product.""",Negative,1,6
